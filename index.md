## Hello! I am Vaibhav Sarkale, Senior IT Consultant and Project Manager

Hi! I am currently working in the IT Consulting industry with Deloitte Consulting in the role of IT Project/Program Manager where I help large clients help transition, stabilize and optimally run packaged ERP driven multi million-dollar IT engagements.

## What this site is about
This site is my extended portfolio where I organize what doesn't fit neatly into LinkedIn: my AI Learnings, Toastmasters Journey and Reading notes

## Why I created this site
LinkedIn shows my career.
I built this site to show my work: the thinking, learning and the experiments that shape my professional identity, in an organized manner that is meaningful for my audience.

Hope you find something interesting here :P
