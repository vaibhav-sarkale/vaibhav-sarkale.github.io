## Hello :wave: I am Vaibhav Sarkale, Senior IT Consultant and Project Manager

Hi! I am currently working in the IT Consulting industry with Deloitte Consulting in the role of IT Project/Program Manager. My work helps large clients help optimally run packaged ERP driven multi million-dollar IT engagements and realize value from thier digital transformation investments.

## Why I created this site
LinkedIn shows my career. I built this site to show my work.

This site is my extended portfolio where I organize what doesn't fit neatly into LinkedIn: :man_technologist: my AI Learnings, :microphone: Toastmasters Journey and :book: Reading notes

All these may look like disconnected tracks, but for me they are simply how I stay curious, learn faster and communicate better. These are the skills I know I'll need as I grow more into strategic roles.

Hope you too find something interesting here :wink:
