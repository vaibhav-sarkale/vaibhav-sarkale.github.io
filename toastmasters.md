## What is Toastmasters International?
Toastmasters International is the leading nonprofit organization devoted to creating effective leaders and communicators worldwide. Through its network of 13,000+ member clubs accross the globe, Toastmasters International helps people learn the arts of speaking, listening and thinking — vital skills that promote selfactualization, enhance leadership potential, foster human understanding. 

Every major city in India now has a active network of multiple Toastmasters clubs.

I have been an active Toastmaster over 6 years now.

## My Toastmasters Philosophy
I am deeply passionate about communication & public speaking since childhood. I have come to realize it as a powerful life skill in professional and personal life. 

Storytelling and an impactful voice are few of my strength areas. 

I look forward to regular club meetings as a safe space to work with like minded people to 
1. further strengthen these skills
2. work on becoming a better project manager

I also look at Toastmasters as a way to keep contributing in the non-profit space through helping people communicate effectively.

## My Speech Topics
So far, I have given over 40 speeches in various clubs across India and few other countries. My speeches are usually focussed on
- How to be a better manager/leader
- Curiosity driven learning
- Book-inspired narratives
- Reflections from my own professional experiences
