We are all in a hoard to learn a thing or two about AI. But few of us are making an effort to organize what we are learning, 'hoping' we can bring it all together some day.

I created this portfolio to avoid falling in this trap. And also because I drop this line 'Hope cannot be a strategy' with a lot of swag, on my team mates :smile:

My firm believes learning ≠ knowledge.

Infact the correct formula for learning = Knowledge + Experiences + Exposure

So I have organized this page in these three sections.
