We are all in a hoard to learn a thing or two about AI. But few of us are making an effort to organize what we are learning, 'hoping' we can bring it all together some day.

I created this portfolio to avoid falling in this trap:smile:.

Deloitte taught me that the correct formula for learning is **Learning = Knowledge + Experiences + Exposure** and not just knowledge itself.

So I have organized this page in these three sections.

## Knowledge

### Certifications
- AWS AI Practitioner, Active

### Books on AI

## Courses Completed on AI
- Generative AI Overview for Project Managers, Project Management Institute (PMI)
- Data Landscape of GenAI for Project Managers, Project Management Institude (PMI)

## Experiences

### Personal Projects Developed
This section is work in progress

### Firm level activities
This section is work in progress

## Exposures
This section is work in progress.
