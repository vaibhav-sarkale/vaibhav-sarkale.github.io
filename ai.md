We are all in a hoard to learn a thing or two about AI. But few of us are making an effort to organize what we are learning, 'hoping' we can bring it all together some day. Also since AI revolution is going to transform us and our society in profound ways, I am interested in learning about AI in a holistic fashion. By that, what I mean to say is I dont want to focus on 'tech' aspects alone.

I created this portfolio to avoid falling in these traps:smile:.

Deloitte taught me that the correct formula for learning is **Learning = Knowledge + Experience + Exposure** and not just knowledge itself.

So I have organized this page in these three sections.

# Knowledge

### Certifications
- AWS AI Practitioner, Active

### Books on AI

## Courses Completed on AI
- Generative AI Overview for Project Managers, Project Management Institute (PMI)
- Data Landscape of GenAI for Project Managers, Project Management Institude (PMI)

# Experience

### Personal Projects Developed
This section is work in progress

### Firm level activities
This section is work in progress

# Exposure
This section is work in progress.
