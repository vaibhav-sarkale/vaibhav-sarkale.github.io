*‘Reading with me, is not a hobby, its a disease.’* - Theodore Roosevelt

I am a proud patient of this disease:sweat_smile:

I read widely, both fiction and non-fiction in multiple languages, but management non fiction and biography are my favorite genres.

But here I am going to focus on professional reading on topics like Communication, Management and technology related literature. These are focussed on investigating specific problems around workplace like how do I become a better communicator, how do we use AI effectively and so on.

All summaries are my original notes + PDF Decks
